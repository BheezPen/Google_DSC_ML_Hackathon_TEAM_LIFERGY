Problem Statement - To predict (1) power consumption, (2) downtime, and (3) diesel consumption in hybrid telecommunications?

Point:
- design machine learning-based solutions that can be trained on datasets of few scenarios and then generalise successfully to data from scenarios not seen before

aim - buidl 3 models
objectives - 

I. Predict Downtime:
Develop a model to predict downtime occurrences in hub sites.
Consider site configurations from Appendices A, B, and C for accurate predictions.
Predict both the date and time of potential downtime events.

II. Estimate Power Consumption:
Develop a model to estimate energy consumption in different hub sites.
Consider power sources such as Grid, Generator, Battery, and Solar as per configurations in Appendices A, B, and C.
The model should identify unexpected increases in power consumption that haven't been seen before.

III. Estimate Diesel Consumption:
Develop a model to estimate the rate of change in diesel consumption for different hub sites.
Consider configurations from Appendices A, B, and C for accurate predictions.
Flag any sudden sharp negative changes in diesel consumption as anomalies.
